MASTER PROMPT: Production-Grade XAI Visual Quality Control Module (Makerkit Edition)
0) Quick Instructions to the Copilot
You are an expert software and MLOps engineer. Your task is to design, implement, test, and deliver the backend services and API for a production-grade Explainable AI (XAI) Visual Quality Control module.
The User Interface (UI) will be a Makerkit/Next.js application. Your primary responsibility is to provide a robust, well-documented API for this UI to consume.
Follow the architecture, deliverables, and strict rules outlined below. Adherence to the project structure and naming conventions is mandatory.
You must deliver working backend code, comprehensive tests, documentation, and a CI/CD pipeline, all containerized with Docker.
Crucially, you must update CHANGELOG.md and DEVELOPMENT_REGISTER.json before every commit.
Write clean, typed Python (3.10+) using type hints, Google-style docstrings, and PEP8 formatting.
Implement robust, well-tested minimal functionality instead of leaving TODO placeholders.
No emojis are to be used in any generated code, documentation, or commit messages.
1) Mission Summary & System Architecture
A. Mission
Build the reproducible and traceable backend module that:
Detects and segments defects in radiographic and standard vision images.
Generates visual explanations using Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients.
Quantifies model uncertainty (MC-Dropout, Ensembles) and performs calibration (ECE, Temperature Scaling).
Tracks a comprehensive suite of business and technical metrics (e.g., FN, FP, mAP, IoU).
Exposes a robust FastAPI backend with a clearly defined API contract for the Makerkit frontend.
Integrates MLflow for experiment tracking and DVC for data and model versioning.

2) Mandatory SaaS Integration (Makerkit)
Requirement: The entire system is built upon Makerkit. Your backend module is a service provider to the Makerkit Next.js frontend.
Manifest: Set makerkit_required: true and specify makerkit_version in module.yaml. Document the Makerkit license and installation steps in README.md.
Authentication: Your API must be secured and expect authentication tokens from the Makerkit frontend. Implement an adapter in api/middleware.py to validate Makerkit JWTs and map its roles to module-specific permissions (e.g., operator, admin).
CI/CD: The CI pipeline must include an integration smoke test that verifies the API endpoints can be reached and that the Makerkit authentication flow is correctly handled using a stub token from CI secrets.
3) Mandatory Files & Change Tracking

5) Technical & Functional Requirements
A. XAI Implementations (backend/core/xai/)
Implement all four explainers. Each must return a numpy.ndarray heatmap (values in).
gradcam.py: Class-saliency mapping for PyTorch models.
shap_explainer.py: Image explainer using the shap library.
lime_explainer.py: Superpixel-based LIME with deterministic seeding.
integrated_gradients.py: IG with a configurable baseline and steps.
aggregator.py: Combine explanations via pixel-wise mean/median and compute a consensus score.
B. Uncertainty & Calibration (backend/core/uncertainty/)
mc_dropout.py: Implement mc_dropout_predict(model, image, n_samples) to return (mean_prediction, variance).
calibration.py: Implement calculate_ece(...), temperature_scaling(...), and plot_reliability_diagram(...).
C. Metrics (backend/core/metrics/)
business_metrics.py: Functions to calculate FN, FP, TP, TN, Precision, Recall, F1.
detection_metrics.py: Functions for AUROC and mAP.
segmentation_metrics.py: Functions for IoU and Dice Score.
D. API Specification (FastAPI in backend/api/)
Implement the following endpoints in api/routes.py with Pydantic schemas in api/schemas.py. These endpoints form the contract with the frontend.
POST /api/xai-qc/detect: Accepts an image file, returns a DetectionResponse with detections and base64-encoded segmentation masks.
POST /api/xai-qc/explain: Accepts an image ID, returns URLs or base64-encoded data for all four XAI heatmaps plus the aggregated result.
GET /api/xai-qc/metrics: Returns key performance metrics over a specified date range.
POST /api/xai-qc/export: Generates a PDF/Excel report and returns a URL to it.
GET /api/xai-qc/calibration: Returns the current ECE and calibration status.
GET /api/xai-qc/health: A simple health check probe.
E. UI Requirements (to be implemented in Makerkit/Next.js)
Your backend API must fully support a UI with the following features:
Image Upload & Display: Ability to upload an image and view it with overlaid defect bounding boxes/masks sent from the API.
Explanation Viewer: A tabbed or selectable interface to display each XAI heatmap (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME, IG, Aggregated).
Data Display: Panels to show confidence scores, uncertainty metrics, and severity classifications.
Actions: An "Export Report" button that triggers a call to your /export endpoint.
6) MLOps, CI/CD, and Deployment
A. MLOps (MLflow & DVC)
MLflow: In scripts/train.py, log all parameters, metrics, artifacts, and the final model to MLflow.
DVC: Create a dvc.yaml with stages for preprocess, train, and evaluate. Ensure the data/ and models/checkpoints/ directories are tracked by DVC.
B. CI, Linting, and Pre-Commit
CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml): Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs pip install, pytest --cov=core, and flake8 within the backend directory.
Pre-Commit: Add a pre-commit-config.yaml with hooks for black, isort, ruff, and a custom script that fails the commit if CHANGELOG.md or DEVELOPMENT_REGISTER.json were not modified.
C. Docker and Deployment
backend/Dockerfile: A multi-stage Dockerfile that creates an optimized production image for the FastAPI service.
docker-compose.yml: A Docker Compose file to orchestrate the backend API service and a standard Node.js service for the Makerkit frontend. It should manage networking and environment variables for local development.
7) Documentation & Deliverables
backend/README.md: Must contain clear instructions to build, run, and test the backend service. Include OpenAPI/Swagger documentation links and example curl commands.
frontend/README.md: A basic README explaining that this directory is for the Makerkit UI and how it connects to the backend service.
model_card.yaml & dataset_card.yaml: Populate these files with details about the model architecture, performance, and the dataset used.
Demo Notebook (notebooks/demo.ipynb): A short notebook demonstrating direct interaction with the Python backend's core functions.
Final Deliverables: A full Git repository, a docker-compose.yml for running the full stack, and populated CHANGELOG.md and DEVELOPMENT_REGISTER.json files.
8) Quality & Acceptance Criteria
Functional
All four XAI methods are implemented and unit-tested in the backend.
Uncertainty and calibration methods are implemented and tested.
FastAPI endpoints are fully functional, documented, and covered by integration tests.
The API provides all necessary data for the specified UI features.
MLflow and DVC are correctly integrated.
Non-Functional
Test Coverage: >90% for the backend/core/ package and backend/api/ routes.
Code Quality: Adheres to PEP8, includes type hints, and has clear docstrings.
Security: API is secured, requires auth tokens, and validates all inputs.
Inference Latency: <200ms for a single image on a standard CPU (document benchmarks).
9) Copilot Execution Plan & Rules
A. Step-by-Step Execution
Initialize the repo structure (backend/, frontend/, docker-compose.yml) and create baseline CHANGELOG.md and DEVELOPMENT_REGISTER.json for version 0.1.0.
Implement a minimal detection model and unit tests in backend/core/.
Implement the XAI, uncertainty, and calibration methods with tests.
Develop the FastAPI endpoints, schemas, and API tests. This defines the contract for the frontend.
Integrate MLflow and DVC into the backend/scripts/.
Set up the CI workflow and pre-commit hooks for the backend.
Finalize the backend Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and all documentation.
B. Commit & Branching Rules
Use feature branches: feat/<description> or fix/<description>.
Update CHANGELOG.md and DEVELOPMENT_REGISTER.json before every commit.
Use structured commit messages: feat(api): add explain endpoint — closes #issue-number.
C. Failure & Fallback Guidance
If a complex algorithm is not feasible, implement a simpler, fully-tested substitute and document this limitation and the reason in CHANGELOG.md and DEVELOPMENT_REGISTER.json.
Use a TODO section in CHANGELOG.md to list any deferred features.
Final Note: This prompt is your single source of truth for the backend service. Your goal is to create a secure, reliable, and well-documented API that the Makerkit frontend team can build upon. Follow it strictly.
