# ✅ Models Successfully Uploaded to GitHub via Git LFS

**Date**: October 22, 2025

## 🎯 What Was Done

Successfully configured **Git Large File Storage (LFS)** and uploaded trained models to GitHub.

## 📦 Models Uploaded

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `backend/models/yolo/radikal_weld_detection/weights/best.pt` | 21.48 MB | Your trained YOLOv8s model (99.88% mAP@0.5) |
| `backend/models/yolo/radikal_weld_detection/weights/last.pt` | 21.48 MB | Last training checkpoint |
| `backend/yolo11n.pt` | ~6 MB | YOLOv11 nano pretrained model |
| `backend/yolov8s.pt` | ~22 MB | YOLOv8s pretrained model |

**Total uploaded**: ~51 MB via Git LFS

## ⚙️ Configuration Changes

### 1. Git LFS Setup
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.pt" "*.pth"
```

### 2. `.gitattributes` Created
```
*.pt filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.pth filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

### 3. `.gitignore` Updated
- Excluded epoch checkpoints to save space (epoch0.pt, epoch5.pt, etc.)
- Only `best.pt` and `last.pt` are tracked
- Saves ~640 MB from being uploaded

## 🚀 For Team Members

When cloning the repository, models will be automatically downloaded:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZenleX-Dost/RadiKal-V2.0.git
cd RadiKal-V2.0

# Models are automatically pulled by Git LFS
# Check if models are available:
ls backend/models/yolo/radikal_weld_detection/weights/
```

### If Models Don't Download Automatically:

```bash
# Install Git LFS if not installed
git lfs install

# Pull LFS files
git lfs pull
```

## 📊 Git LFS Quota

**GitHub Free Account**:
- Storage: 1 GB
- Bandwidth: 1 GB/month
- Current usage: ~51 MB (5% of quota)

**Your current models**: Well within free tier limits! ✅

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Epoch checkpoints are NOT pushed** - Only `best.pt` and `last.pt`
2. **If you retrain**, new `best.pt` will be pushed automatically
3. **LFS files don't count toward repository size** in GitHub UI
4. **Collaborators need Git LFS installed** to download models

## 🔄 Updating Models

When you retrain and want to update the model:

```bash
# Models are automatically staged because they're tracked
git add backend/models/yolo/radikal_weld_detection/weights/best.pt
git commit -m "Update model after retraining"
git push origin main
```

## ✨ Benefits

✅ Easy to share with team  
✅ Automatic download on clone  
✅ No manual upload/download needed  
✅ Free within GitHub limits
